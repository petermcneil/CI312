### Lab 3: Polygon Meshes

#### Task

1. Understand geometry in example file
2. Creating a 3D geometry
3. Implementing the geometry
4. Changing the camera view
5. (Extension) Load a 3D polygonal mesh from a file

#### Journey

1. Understanding geometry in example (triangle.cpp) file

GL_TRIANGLES
3 vertices
For mine 1

2. Creating a 3D geometry
