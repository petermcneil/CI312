## Parent project of CI312

This is the parent project for CI312 - Computer Graphics Algorithm module. The sub directories contain completed tutorials.


All code was written on MacOS, therefore contains Bash/MacOS specific commands.

### Build Commands

For your convienice I have written a small `Makefile` in the top directory.
It will replace the hardcoded path for the shaders/assets to one that is specific
to you.


Lab 1 - `make lab1`

Lab 2 - `make lab2`

Lab 3 - `make lab3` || `make lab3File`

Lab 4 - `make lab4`
